<h5 class="text-prim-color">FRONT END WEB DEVELOPER</h5>
<p>The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including design and some languages like HTML and CSS. There are a lot of different jobs associated with the front-end. Keep in mind that a lot of these titles are subjective, and while front-end developer may mean something at one company, it can mean something completely different at another company. A common front-end job title is "web designer." A web designer, you guessed it, designs websites. The job title of web designer is pretty broad, though. A web designer could just be someone who designs the sites in a program like Photoshop or Fireworks and will never touch the code. But in another location, a web designer could do all the design comps in Photoshop, and then be responsible for creating all the HTML and CSS (and sometimes even JavaScript) to go along with it.
